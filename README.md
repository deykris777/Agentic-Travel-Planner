# ✈️ Agentic Travel Planner

An **Agentic AI–based Travel Feasibility Analysis System** built using **Python (Flask)**.  
The application analyzes a user's travel plan and determines whether it is feasible based on **budget, duration, travel style, and estimated costs**, while also explaining *why* a trip is affordable or not.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Agentic Travel Planner** behaves like an **intelligent agent** that:

1. **Observes** user inputs (country, city, days, budget, travel style)
2. **Reasons** using cost models and constraints
3. **Decides** feasibility (Affordable / Risky / Not Feasible)
4. **Explains** its decision using confidence scores and reasoning

This makes the system **agentic**, not just a static calculator.

---

## 🧠 What Makes This an *Agentic AI* Project?

Unlike normal applications, this project uses **agent-based decision logic**:

- Autonomous decision-making based on rules
- Multi-factor reasoning (stay, travel, buffer)
- Confidence scoring
- Explanation generation (“Why feasible / not feasible?”)

The agent simulates how a human travel planner would think.
